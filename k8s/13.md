## Question answers

### Describe and explain differences in the report

- Results differ because there is a personal load balancer and volume per each replica, therefore requests get directed differently.

### Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app

- Each pod has its own visits.txt, so ordering guarantees are unnecessary.
