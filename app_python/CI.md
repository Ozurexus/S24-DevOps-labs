# Task 2: CI Workflow Improvements

## 1. Workflow Enhancements

1. I implemented caching for dependencies to enhance workflow efficiency.
2. I added a workflow status badge to my repository for visibility.
3. I added Snyk vulnerability checks to my CI workflow to identify and address vulnerabilities in my projects.
