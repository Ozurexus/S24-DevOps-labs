# Lab 1: Web Application Development

## Task 1: Python Web Application

- I developed a Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow using **Flask** framework. I chose because it is a lightweight framework for web development which is a good fit for small projects.

- The application was first **manually tested** to ensure the displayed time updates upon page refreshing.

## Task 2: Well Decorated Description

1. Best Practices for the Web Application:
   - The web application is developed using **Flask** framework which is a lightweight framework for web development.
   - The code is formatted using **Black** and follows the **PEP 8** coding standards.
   - The application is tested to ensure the displayed time updates upon page refreshing.
   - The code is formatted using **Black** and follows the **PEP 8** coding standards. It is also checked using **pylint** VSCode extension.
   - The application is tested using **app_test.py** to ensure it is available when active and the displayed time is correct.
   - All files are organized in a clean structure: app code in src, tests in tests, and html in templates.
   - The `.gitignore` file is created, but it is empty because there are no files to ignore.
   - The `requirements.txt` file is concise and includes only the required dependencies.
