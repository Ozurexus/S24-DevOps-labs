# Lab 1: Web Application Development

## Bonus Task: Additional Web Application

- I developed a web application using the **JavaScript** programming language. I chose JavaScript because it is a popular language for web development and is widely used for creating interactive web pages.
- The application was manually tested to ensure it works as expected.
- I used **Linter** to check the code for errors and ensure it follows best practices.
- Time auto-updates every second.
- .gitignore file is created? but not used, as there are no files to ignore.
